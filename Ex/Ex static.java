/// static method -> can call without created object
/// static variable -> attach with class (not object!)

/// Ex 1
// class bla{
// 	public static method(){
// 		return blaaaa
// 	}
// }

/// *** Tips : if method is about calculation => should declare static method ***
/// *** Dont forget to declare "static method" in class if want to play with "static variable" : it's just rule ***
